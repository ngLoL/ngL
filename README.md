## Purpose

The purpose of this application was to enable competitive League of Legends players a way to understand their current season stats in a fun and interactive manner. During the conception of this project, we acknowledged that there are a lot of great websites out there already that focus on a player's stats, but we wanted to add a new twist and engineer a UI that encouraged user interaction, while allowing the users to understand their stats more holistically through charts and graphs.

Fun Fact!

We came up with the name "ngL" based on two reasons:
  1. The main reason being that our app was "not gonna lie" (like the acronym ngl) about your stats. HAHAHAHA... sorry, we know we are lame.
  2. Both of our last names end in "-ng" (Hong and Kang)

## Journey

### Jason's Thoughts, Learning Experiences, etc.

While developing this app, one obstacle we had to overcome was the fact that our website, initially, looked very two-dimensional. This "flat" feeling elicited unpleasant experiences in me from a UX standpoint and to correct this, I decided to implement modern card designs. Incorporating stats into cards seemed like the most ideal route for our website because cards are naturally intuitive as units of information. However, slapping cards onto our website would make it monotonous (or so we thought) and we wanted the users to be constantly engaged (stats should be fun!), so I added different hover animations for each respective module. To witness it yourself, check out the demo below!
